Smart home:
* Lighting based on user location (within the house)
* Door Lock status detection with notifications if user leaves house without locking
* Outside lighting based on proximity to the house (drunk drive me home light)
* Heating & cooling based on user location (including holiday low power)
* Computer shutdown / startup or ambiental music startup / shutdown based on user location (in house & outside)
* Custom object status notification based on user location (ironing left  in power plug after user leaves home)




Important technologies:
* GPS / A-GPS 
* GeoLocation 
* Internet Weather (temperature/humidity/etc)
* Proximity sensors
* Temperature sensors
* High fidelity distance sensors or contact detection (?)
* Raspberry PI - Central logic box
* Mobile app technologies (iOS vs Android vs Mobile Web)
* Cell phone tower detection (increased positioning quality)
* Bluetooth detection (increased positioning quality)
* Wifi network SSID detection (increased positioning quality)
* Python vs Php vs Javascript (?) - Study later
